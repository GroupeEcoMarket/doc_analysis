geometry:
  # Capture Type Classification (SCAN vs PHOTO)
  # Automatically detects whether the input is a scanned document or a photo
  capture_classifier:
    enabled: true  # Enable/disable automatic capture type detection
    # Pixel value threshold (0-255) to consider a pixel as white.
    # Higher values (e.g., 250) are stricter and may misclassify slightly gray scans as photos.
    # Lower values (e.g., 240) are more lenient and may classify photos with bright backgrounds as scans.
    white_level_threshold: 245
    # Percentage of white pixels required to classify as SCAN.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.80) require more white space, making classification stricter.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.60) are more lenient and may misclassify photos with lots of white space.
    white_percentage_threshold: 0.70
    # If SCAN is detected, skip the intelligent crop step (doctr).
    # Scans typically don't need cropping, saving processing time.
    skip_crop_if_scan: true
  
  # Orientation Detection (ONNX model)
  # Detects and corrects document orientation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)
  orientation:
    # Minimum confidence threshold to accept the detected orientation.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.85) are stricter and may skip correction on ambiguous documents.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.60) are more lenient but may apply incorrect corrections.
    min_confidence: 0.70
    
  # Intelligent Crop (doctr)
  # Automatically crops the document from the background
  crop:
    enabled: true  # Enable/disable intelligent cropping
    # Minimum area ratio the document must occupy in the image to skip cropping.
    # If the document occupies less than this ratio, cropping will be applied.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.90) are stricter and will crop more aggressively.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.75) are more lenient and may leave more background.
    min_area_ratio: 0.85
    # Maximum margin ratio threshold for overcrop_risk flag.
    # If the detected crop margin exceeds this ratio (> 8% of an edge), a warning is raised.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.05) are stricter and flag more potential overcrops.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.12) are more lenient and may miss actual overcrop issues.
    max_margin_ratio: 0.08
    
  # Deskew (Angle Correction)
  # Corrects document rotation/angle skew
  deskew:
    enabled: true
    # Confidence threshold for applying angle correction.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.5) make deskew stricter and avoid false positives on straight documents.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.10) are more lenient but may apply unnecessary corrections.
    min_confidence: 0.20
    # Maximum acceptable angle (in degrees) for correction.
    # Angles beyond this threshold will not be corrected (may indicate a rotated scan).
    # Lower values (e.g., 10.0) are stricter and only correct small angles.
    # Higher values (e.g., 20.0) allow correction of more severe skews.
    max_angle: 15.0
    # Minimum angle threshold to apply deskew (ignore very small angles).
    # Prevents unnecessary corrections for near-perfect documents.
    # Higher values (e.g., 1.0) ignore more small angles, reducing processing.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.2) are more sensitive and may correct minimal skews.
    min_angle: 0.5
    # Threshold for Hough line detection algorithm.
    # Increasing this value (e.g., 150) detects fewer lines, making angle detection more robust on clean documents.
    # Decreasing it (e.g., 50) can help on documents with sparse text or few lines.
    hough_threshold: 100
    
  # Image Quality Checks
  # Validates and enforces minimum quality standards
  quality:
    # Minimum contrast value after enhancement.
    # Documents below this threshold will be flagged as low_contrast_after_enhance.
    # Higher values (e.g., 70) are stricter and flag more low-contrast documents.
    # Lower values (e.g., 40) are more lenient but may accept poor quality images.
    min_contrast: 50
    # Minimum width (in pixels) for the final processed image.
    # Images below this width will be flagged as too_small_final.
    # Higher values (e.g., 1500) enforce higher resolution requirements.
    # Lower values (e.g., 1000) are more lenient but may accept low-resolution images.
    min_resolution_width: 1200
    # Minimum height (in pixels) for the final processed image.
    # Images below this height will be flagged as too_small_final.
    # Higher values (e.g., 2000) enforce higher resolution requirements.
    # Lower values (e.g., 1400) are more lenient but may accept low-resolution images.
    min_resolution_height: 1600

# ==========================================
# PDF PROCESSING
# ==========================================

pdf:
  # DPI (dots per inch) for PDF to image conversion.
  # Higher values (e.g., 400) produce higher quality images but increase file size and processing time.
  # Lower values (e.g., 200) are faster but may result in lower quality, especially for small text.
  dpi: 300
  # Minimum DPI threshold.
  # PDFs with lower DPI will be flagged or upscaled.
  # This ensures consistent quality across all processed documents.
  min_dpi: 300

# ==========================================
# QA FLAGS
# ==========================================

    low_confidence_orientation: 0.70
    # Threshold for flagging potential overcrop risk (as percentage of edge).

    # Should match geometry.crop.max_margin_ratio for consistency.
    overcrop_risk: 0.08
    # Threshold for flagging low contrast after enhancement.
    # If contrast is below this value, the low_contrast_after_enhance flag is raised.
    # Should match geometry.quality.min_contrast for consistency.
    low_contrast: 50
    # Threshold for flagging images that are too small (width).
    # If final image width is below this value, the too_small_final flag is raised.
    # Should match geometry.quality.min_resolution_width for consistency.
    too_small_width: 1200
    # Threshold for flagging images that are too small (height).
    # If final image height is below this value, the too_small_final flag is raised.
    # Should match geometry.quality.min_resolution_height for consistency.
    too_small_height: 1600

  # Checkbox Detection
  # Detects and classifies checkboxes (checked/unchecked)
  checkboxes:
    enabled: false  # Enable/disable checkbox detection
    # Confidence threshold for detecting a checkbox element.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.75) are stricter and only detect clear checkboxes, reducing false positives.
    # Lower values (e.g., 0.50) are more lenient but may detect non-checkbox elements.
    min_confidence: 0.60
    # Threshold for considering a checkbox as "checked".
    # Value between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the fill ratio or confidence of checked state.
    # Higher values (e.g., 0.7) are stricter and only mark clearly checked boxes.

# ==========================================
# PERFORMANCE
# ==========================================

  # JPEG is suitable for photos but may introduce compression artifacts on text.
  image_format: "png"
  # JPEG quality (1-100) if image_format is "jpg".
